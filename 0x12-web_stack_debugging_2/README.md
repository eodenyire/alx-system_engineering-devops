# 0x12. Web Stack Debugging #2

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program, specifically focusing on web stack debugging. It includes tasks that involve configuring and debugging Nginx and running processes as different users. The project was undertaken by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira, a Senior Data Analytics Engineer at Safaricom PLC and a graduate student at The Cooperative University of Kenya pursuing a Masters of Science in Data Science.

## Tasks

### 0. Run Software as Another User

**Objective:** Create a script that accepts one argument and runs the `whoami` command under the user specified by the argument.

**File:** `0-iamsomeoneelse`

**Usage:**
