# 0x15. API

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program, focusing on using APIs to gather and manipulate data. It involves various scripts to interact with APIs, export data to different formats, and manage data structures.

## Project Files

1. **`0-gather_data_from_an_API.py`**: A Python script to gather data from a specified API endpoint.
2. **`1-export_to_CSV.py`**: Exports the gathered API data into a CSV file.
3. **`2-export_to_JSON.py`**: Exports the gathered API data into a JSON file.
4. **`3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py`**: A Python script to convert data into a dictionary of lists of dictionaries format.
5. **`todo_all_employees.json`**: A JSON file containing sample data for all employees.
6. **`2.csv`**: The CSV file output from the `1-export_to_CSV.py` script.
7. **`2.json`**: The JSON file output from the `2-export_to_JSON.py` script.
