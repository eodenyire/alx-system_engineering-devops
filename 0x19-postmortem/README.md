# 0x19. Postmortem

## Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program, under the System Engineering & DevOps track. The focus of this project is to understand and apply the concept of a postmortem in the context of software outages. A postmortem is an essential tool for analyzing and learning from system failures, ensuring that the same issues do not recur.

## Background Context

Any software system is susceptible to failure due to various reasons such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, or human error. It is crucial to analyze these failures to prevent their recurrence. A postmortem allows teams to document the causes of the outage, the timeline of the events, the resolution process, and the preventive measures to avoid future incidents.

## Project Tasks

### Task 0: My First Postmortem
For this task, I have documented a postmortem based on a hypothetical or real web stack debugging issue. The postmortem includes:

- **Issue Summary**:
  - **Duration of the Outage**: Start and end times (with timezone).
  - **Impact**: Details of the affected services, user experience, and the percentage of users impacted.
  - **Root Cause**: Identification of the primary cause of the outage.
  
- **Timeline**:
  - **Detection**: How and when the issue was detected.
  - **Actions Taken**: Steps taken to diagnose the issue, including any incorrect paths explored.
  - **Resolution**: How the issue was ultimately resolved.

- **Root Cause and Resolution**:
  - A detailed explanation of what caused the issue and the steps taken to fix it.

- **Corrective and Preventative Measures**:
  - A list of improvements and specific tasks to prevent a recurrence of the issue.

### Task 1: Make People Want to Read Your Postmortem
This task challenges us to make our postmortem engaging and informative. Adding humor, diagrams, or other creative elements can make the postmortem more appealing to readers. The goal is to ensure that the postmortem is not only informative but also engaging enough to capture and hold the audience's attention.
