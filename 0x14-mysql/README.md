# ALX Systems Engineering DevOps - 0x14. MySQL

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up and managing MySQL databases on a web stack. The main tasks include installing MySQL, setting up database replication, configuring MySQL for a primary-replica setup, and creating backup strategies. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in MySQL database management and replication, as well as to understand the importance of database backups.

## Tasks

1. **Install MySQL**
   - Install MySQL 5.7.x on both web-01 and web-02 servers.

2. **Let us in!**
   - Create a MySQL user named `holberton_user` on both web-01 and web-02 with the password `projectcorrection280hbtn`. Grant appropriate permissions for replication status checks.

3. **If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes**
   - Create a database named `tyrell_corp` on the primary server (web-01) and add a table named `nexus6` with at least one entry.

4. **Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?**
   - Set up MySQL replication from web-01 (primary) to web-02 (replica). Provide MySQL configuration files for both servers.

5. **MySQL backup**
   - Write a Bash script to generate a MySQL dump of all databases, compress it, and store it with a date-based filename.

## Instructions

1. **Installation**: Follow the instructions in the provided files to install and configure MySQL.
2. **Replication**: Set up replication as described and ensure proper functionality by adding test data and verifying replication.
3. **Backup**: Use the provided Bash script to create and compress MySQL backups.
